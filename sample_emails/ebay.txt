Dear,

At eBay, we strive to make our policies clear and our services easy to use. As part of that commitment, we’re announcing some changes to the eBay User Agreement.

Our updated User Agreement will take effect on February 26, 2020 for all users. You can read the updated User Agreement on eBay.com.

Key updates:

• eBay intends to manage payments for more sellers in more markets in the near future
• Clarification of which user agreement applies when you buy or sell in other countries
• Know when we hold or restrict seller funds

Thank you for being a part of the eBay community.

Sincerly,
eBay Team
